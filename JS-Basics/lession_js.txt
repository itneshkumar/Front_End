// static typed language cann't be changed in future of variable values where as dynamic typed language can be change as per requirement 
let name='Mosh'; //string Literal
let age=30; // number literal
let isApproved=true; //Boolean literal (ture or false)
let firstName; //these are two variable is called undefined variable
let firstName=undefined;
let lastName=null; //null value
//if you want to reassign in future of any value then null value is play vital role
let selectColor=null; //in future like red and green
//This is dynamic language

// let interestRate = .3;
// interestRate=1;
// console.log(interestRate);
//you can reassign but when you use the constant
const interestRate=2;
interestRate=3;
console.log(interestRate);
//you can show the error cann't again reassign the constant like tupple you can't reassign
